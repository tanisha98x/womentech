# womentech
We extremely inspired when we came to Technica and saw over 800 girls and women coding, a lot of whom were in high school and middle school. We wanted to create a web application that would pool together resources and statistics for them as well as raise awareness about women in tech.
We used atom to edit CSS, HTML and JavaScript code. We used python and flask as the back end. For the statistics tab, we embedded micro strategy data visualisation. We also used a form to record the survey answers of users and then provided them with their best fit.
